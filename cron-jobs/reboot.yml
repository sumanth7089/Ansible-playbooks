# Readme.md
# Due to some disk space limitations, we want to cleanup the /tmp location on node00 host after every reboot. Create a playbook ~/playbooks/reboot.yml to add a cron named cleanup on node00 that will execute after every reboot and will clean /tmp location.



# The command should be rm -rf /tmp/*.
