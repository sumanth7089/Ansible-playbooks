##We have a playbook ~/playbooks/web2-config.yml, it has some existing code to change apacheâ€™s default port 80 to port 8082 as we want to run Apache on port 8082 on web2 node. Make some changes as given below before running the playbook.



##A. Add an entry in ~/playbooks/inventory for web2 node, IP address of web2 node is 172.20.1.101 and ssh password and username are same as of web1 (username = root and password = Passw0rd).

##B. Update web2-config.yml to install httpd before updating its port in config, also start/enable its service.

##C. Install firewalld package and start/enable its service.

#D. As now Apache will listen on port 8082 so edit the playbook to add firewall rule in public zone so that Apache can allow all incoming traffic.
